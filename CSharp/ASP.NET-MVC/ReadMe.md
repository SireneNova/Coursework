###ASP.Net MVC Application in C# - The Contoso University
___

####Objective
Create an ASP.NET MVC 5 web application for a fictional university using Entity Framework 6 and Visual Studio.

####Steps Taken
Followed the steps oulined in the link above, summarized below:

**Created Web Project**
* In Visual Studio, a C# an asp.net web application. 
* Changed to authentication settings to have no authentication.

VIEWS FOLDER

**Set up site style by editing Views folder**
* In Views\Shared\_Layout.cshtml:
  * Changed each occurrence of "My ASP.NET Application" and "Application name" to "Contoso University".
  * Added menu entries for Students, Courses, etc in an unordered list so they would appear in a collapsible navigation bar.
* In Views\Home\Index.cshtml:
  * Swapped the html so that the home page will now display information about Contoso University rather than ASP.Net.
* Viewed site by pressing ctrl f5.

**Installed Entity Framework**
* Opened NuGet package manager in Tools.
* Opened Package Manager Console and Ran "Install-Package EntityFramework" command. 

MODELS FOLDER

**Created the Data Model by editing Models folder**
* Created student, enrollment, and course data models as classes in separate cs files in the Models folder. These will serve as entity classes, which define tables in the data model.
  * The classes contain properties such as Name and ID, which will correspond to columns in a table. Example: `public int ID { get; set; }`
  * Courses and Students can have any number of Enrollments. These relationships between the classes/entities are defined by navigation properties. They contain a "virtual" keyword to enable lazy loading. Example: `public virtual ICollection<Enrollment> Enrollments { get; set; }` 
  * In the Enrollment class an enumerable, Grade, was used to define the attribute for the Grade property.
  * The Course class contained a DatabaseGenerated attribute, which allows for entering a primary key rather than have one be generated by the database automatically.

DAL FOLDER

**Created the Database Context by creating the DAL folder**
* Created the DAL (Data Access Layer) folder in the Project Folder (ContosoUniversity) in the Solution Explorer.
* In this folder, created a database context class, the main class that coordinates EF functionality for a given data model. It allows for querying and selecting data. Here it is named SchoolContext.cs.
* Placed code in the file with DBSets class in the model eg: `public DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }`. Entity sets correspond to tables and entities correspond to rows in tables.
* The connection string was explicitly stated even though it didn't need to be: `public SchoolContext() : base("SchoolContext")
{
}` This connects to the Web.config file and takes the name of the class file by default.
* Prevented table names from being pluralized with the "modelBuilder.Conventions.Remove" statement in the OnModelCreating method. 

DAL FOLDER

**Set up EF to Write the Database**
* Used Entity Framework to initialize a database and populate it with test data (student names etc). 
  * Made a an initializer class, SchoolInitializer.cs in the DAL folder.
  * Used the Seed method in the class to automatically populate the db by matching with the correct DBSet.
  * This is dropped and re-created whenever the model changes.
* Initializer class is referenced in web.config to be used.

PROJECT FILES

**Set up EF to use LocalDB** by editing web.config
* Added ```<connectionStrings>
    <add name="SchoolContext" connectionString="Data Source=(LocalDb)\MSSQLLocalDB;Initial Catalog=ContosoUniversity1;Integrated Security=SSPI;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient"/>
</connectionStrings>```

CREATE WEB PAGE
Now you'll create a web page to display data, and the process of requesting the data will automatically 
trigger the creation of the database. 
You'll begin by creating a new controller. But before you do that, build the project to make the model and 
context classes available to MVC controller scaffolding.
When you click Add, the scaffolder creates a StudentController.cs file and a set of views (.cshtml files)
that work with the controller. 


Visual Studio opens the Controllers\StudentController.cs file. You see a class variable has been created that instantiates a database context object:


The Index action method gets a list of students from the Students entity set by reading the Students property of the database context instance:
The Student\Index.cshtml view displays this list in a table:


Added a student controller with views automatically by adding a scaffold item
-this creates a web page that displays data?
-the class variable is found in the Controllers\StudentControllers.cs file. The Index method in the file gets a list of students from the Students entity set by reading the Students property of the database context instance
