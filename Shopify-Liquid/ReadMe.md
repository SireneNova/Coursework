I wanted to make some changes to my Shopify store that I couldn't do through the built-in user interface, so I learned how to access and edit Liquid theme code. My portfolio shows some manual styling changes I figured out. This folder contains more complex reactive changes involving JavaScript that I accomplished by following the Shopify documentation.
